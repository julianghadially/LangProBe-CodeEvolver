      "instructions": "You will be given a `claim` along with a set of factual or encyclopedic `passages` that contain information about people, places, films, events, products, works of art, historical facts, organizations, and other entities. Your task is to produce a concise, accurate, and evidence-based `summary` that evaluates the truthfulness of the claim strictly according to the information in the passages.\n\nSpecifically, follow these detailed guidelines:\n\n1. **Comprehension and Extraction of Key Elements**  \n   - Carefully read and understand the claim and all provided passages.  \n   - Identify key factual elements in the claim, including entities, relationships, dates, titles, roles, events, locations, numeric data, and domain-specific terms.  \n   - Some claims involve multiple components or comparisons (e.g., between people, dates, places, or works); assess each part individually.\n\n2. **Evidence Gathering and Verification**  \n   - Search through all passages for explicit confirmations or contradictions relevant to the claim’s key elements.  \n   - Recognize domain-specific terms (e.g., musical vocal ranges, film industry terminology, dog breed classification, historical figures, place names and their geography, awards and their criteria).  \n   - Pay close attention to small factual details such as correct names, birthdates, titles, and relationships. Minor errors (e.g., misstated names, incorrect dates) should be identified and corrected based on the passages.  \n   - If the claim involves numeric or comparative data (e.g., release years, numbers of band members, awards won), verify these precisely against passage information.\n\n3. **Use of Domain-Specific Knowledge Embedded in Passages**  \n   - Utilize implicit domain knowledge contained in the passages, such as:  \n     - Musical distinctions (e.g., bass vs. baritone singer roles).  \n     - Film production relationships (e.g., identifying directors, producers, or distributors and associating them with works).  \n     - Geographic and historical context (e.g., knowledge of locations, political subdivisions, historical timeframes).  \n     - Mythological or cultural references that appear in the passages.  \n     - Specific naming conventions in each domain.  \n   - Note: Do not use or rely on any external knowledge not present in the given passages.\n\n4. **Determining the Verdict**  \n   - Based on the evidence, decide whether the claim is:  \n     - **Supported**: All significant parts of the claim are confirmed by the passages.  \n     - **Partially Supported**: Some parts are confirmed while others lack evidence or are contradicted.  \n     - **Not Supported**: The claim is contradicted by the passages or the key facts are disproven.  \n     - **Insufficient Evidence**: There is a lack of relevant passage information to verify the claim or certain parts of it.\n\n5. **Constructing the Summary Response**  \n   - Start with a clear verdict from the four categories above.  \n   - Explain which parts are supported, contradicted, or lack evidence, referencing passage content where possible.  \n   - Correct any factual inaccuracies found in the claim based on passage content.  \n   - Maintain a neutral, factual, and concise tone, focusing solely on the evidence relationship between claim and passages.  \n   - Explicitly state when aspects of the claim or referenced entities do not appear in the passages, marking those parts unverified or unsupported.\n\n6. **Special Considerations**  \n   - When claims refer to multiple interconnected facts, assess each fact’s support separately, then synthesize the overall verdict.  \n   - For individuals with similar or multiple names, confirm identities based on passage context before judging claims.  \n   - When claims include temporal comparisons (e.g., who was born first, or which event occurred later), rely strictly on provided birth or event dates.  \n   - For claims about awards, use only passage details to determine which individual or group won, and for which work or year.  \n   - In cases involving creative works (films, music, books), confirm attributions such as authorship, direction, or roles based on the passages.  \n   - If the claim includes entities or information not mentioned at all in the passages, explicitly state that no evidence is available from the passages.\n\nBy adhering strictly to the passage content and incorporating domain-specific knowledge embedded within, your summary will offer an accurate, nuanced, and text-grounded factual assessment of the claim.",
