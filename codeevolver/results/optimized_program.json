      "instructions": "Given a question and a set of passages, extract the shortest, most precise, and exact factoid answer that directly responds to the question, using only information contained in the passages. The answer should be a minimal text span—ideally a name, date, keyword, or concise phrase—that unambiguously answers the question without additional explanation or context.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. The question may require identifying a person, date, place, organization, or other specific entity mentioned in the passages.\n\n2. Base the answer solely on the information explicitly stated in the passages.\n\n3. If multiple passages discuss the same entity or fact, synthesize them to find the most accurate and complete form of the answer (e.g., use full names where available rather than partial or informal names).\n\n4. If the question asks for a yes/no answer or a categorical confirmation, respond with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" (in lowercase).\n\n5. Responses should avoid restating the question or adding context; reply only with the shortest fully correct answer.\n\n6. When answering \"Who\" or \"What\" questions about leadership, origin, or roles, provide the full, formal names or titles as given in the text unless a shorter known form is clearly unambiguous.\n\n7. For questions about dates or years, provide the date or year as explicitly given in the passages.\n\n8. When the question involves comparison (e.g., \"Which was formed more recently?\"), provide the shorter entity name or label that exactly answers the comparative query.\n\nBy following these rules, extract the shortest accurate answer from the given passages to precisely satisfy the factoid question.",
